= Send alert on Fortigate configuration changed by administrator with details

_Task_: Each time any configuration is being changed send an email that will also contain the detailed description of what changes were made. 

NOTE: This stitch will fire on *every* change made by the administrator and 
in *real-time*, each time the admin clicks on _Apply_ in GUI, or enters
_end/next_ in CLI. In GUI, the log ids are 44546 and 44547 and called _Attribute configured_ and _Object attribute configured_.
